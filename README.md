This is a collection of R code I used to analyze personal fantasy football data for a 6-year period. 
A summary of the results can be found at the following links:

The file 'GRAPH_histograms.R' has code to graph various fantasy player statistics, contained in
file 'graphdata.csv'.

The directory 'playoffseeds' contains a shiny application that charts how playoff results
would have changed had various bonuses been given to the top seeded teams.
